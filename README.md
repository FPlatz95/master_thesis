# Master Thesis 
- By Huy Duc Nguyen and Frederik Platz 

This repository contains the code base of our master thesis conducted in the Albertsen Lab at Aalborg University, section of microbial diversity. 

## Thesis Aim 
The thesis aims to build a pipeline for taxonomic classification and ARG mining of 10.000 illumina sequenced shallow metagenomes. Furthermore it aims to utilize this pipeline by a using it on 170 agricultural samples, from which agricultural metadata is provided. 
The pipeline was established by testing a wide varierity of tools on WWTP samples. These were the evaluated, and some were discarded. 
The tools remaining were used on ~ 500 samples from microflora danica (MFD), and the the final choice of Taxonomic classifier and ARG mining tool were choosen. 
Finally
